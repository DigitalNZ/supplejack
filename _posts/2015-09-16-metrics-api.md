The Metrics API can be queried to retrieve metrics information for a day or a range of days. The current metrics it provides are usage (record views, types of views) and display_collection (statistics on display\_collections, number of records in them, breakdown of copyright/categories).

To view the Swagger API documentation you can use the [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io), to load the Swagger API definition use `File -> Import URL...` using
`https://digitalnz.github.io/supplejack/assets/swagger.json` as the URL.
