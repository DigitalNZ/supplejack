The Supplejack Common is a gem which provides the DSL for parsers in Supplejack. It is comprised of strategies for different types of harvests, for example JSON, XML, RSS, and OAI. The purpose of the gem is to abstract all the DSL specific code for the [Supplejack Manager](http://digitalnz.github.io/supplejack/start/supplejack-manager.html) and the [Supplejack Worker](http://digitalnz.github.io/supplejack/start/supplejack-worker.html).

You should not need to update this project unless a change to [the DSL](http://digitalnz.github.io/supplejack/manager/parser-dsl-domain-specific-language.html) needs to be made.
