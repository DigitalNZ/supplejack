The Supplejack API is a [mountable engine](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html) which provides functionality to store, index and retrieve metadata via an API.

This wiki provides a guide on how to create and configure your API as well as an introduction to the rest of the Supplejack project.

## Getting started

Before starting you should check that you have all the [dependancies](Dependancies) installed.

Once that is complete we strongly recommend using the [Supplejack template](https://github.com/DigitalNZ/supplejack_template) to create your app. This template will create a new app which includes the Supplejack API engine and then step through the configuration options. 

For details about how to install Supplejack Template, see [Install & Setup](Install & Setup)

Once the install is complete you should have a working API. The next step is to [configure your schema](Schema) so that you can configure the fields that are stored/returned by your API.
