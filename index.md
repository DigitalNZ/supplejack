# What is Supplejack?

Supplejack is a platform for managing the harvesting and manipulation of metadata. It was originally developed to manage the sourcing of collection metadata for the [DigitalNZ](http://www.digitalnz.org/) aggregation service, and has grown to a platform that can manage millions of records from hundreds of data sources.

Its main purpose is to manage the process of fetching data from remote sources, mapping data to a standard data schema, managing any quality control or enrichment processes, and surfacing the standardised data via a public API. Find our [more about its features](/supplejack/about.html), review the [architecture](/supplejack/architecture.html), and access the full [Supplejack code repos](https://github.com/DigitalNZ) on GitHub.
