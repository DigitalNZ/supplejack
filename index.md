# What is Supplejack?

Supplejack is a Ruby on Rails platform for managing the harvesting and manipulation of data, typically metadata about collection items. It was originally developed to manage the sourcing of collection metadata for the [DigitalNZ](http://www.digitalnz.org/) aggregation service, and has grown to a platform that can manage millions of records from hundreds of data sources.

Its main purpose is to manage the process of fetching data from remote sources, mapping data to a standard data schema, managing any quality control or enrichment processes, and surfacing the standardised data via a public API. Find out [more about its features](/supplejack/about.html),  review the [architecture](/supplejack/architecture.html) and join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/supplejack).

### Installation

There are currently three different methods available for installing Supplejack

1. Docker Installation - If you want to get started easily in development and use Docker, then this guide is a quick way to set everything up and see if Supplejack is
right for your needs.

2. Standard Installation - The best place to start for the manual installation ( suitable for use in production ) is the [Installation Walk-through by Example](/supplejack/start/installation-walk-through-by-example). In addition the production install guide can be found [here](/supplejack/start/production-install.html).

3. Script Installation - Less control than the Standard Installation but more than the Docker installation method. This is a relatively quick way to get setup if you don't use
Docker but still want to explore Supplejack and get up and running quickly.

### Contact us or get involved

We are in the early stages of setting up Supplejack as an open source activity. If you have any questions, or would like to work with us on progressing the stack further, you can reach us at [develop@digitalnz.org](mailto:develop@digitalnz.org).

Thanks for your interest!
